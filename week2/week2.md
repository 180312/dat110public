## DAT110: Distributed Systems and Network Technology

### Lab Week 2: 14/01 - 18/01

**WARNING** Exercises under construction - not final yet

#### Exercise 1 - Threads

Distributed and networked applications involve implementing exchange of message between processes that runs on different computers. In many cases, however, the part of a distributed system also involves implementing multi-threaded applications where the thread synchronize and communicate using shared memory

The main purpose of this exercise is to briefly recap inter-thread communication and synchronisation in Java before starting on network programming next week.

- two threads (sensor and display) using sleep
- extension to multiple display threads
- two threads using wait and notity
- multiple display threads using wait and notifyAll

#### Exercise 2 - Wireshark

- find ip address
- find mac addresses

#### Exercise 3 - Producer-Consumer System using BlockingQueue

- extension to multiple consumers
