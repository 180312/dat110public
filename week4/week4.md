### Week 4 Project : 28.01 - 01.02

** WARNING: assignment under construction - nothing final yet

##### Introduction

The labs in week 4 is devoted to project work which is to be undertaken groups of 2-3 students. There will be no lecture on Wednesday 30.01 on the lecture on Friday will serve as an extra lab where the groups can received additional help and/or demonstrate their running application.

The project builds on socket programming and network applications and aims to consolidate some important concepts that have been covered until now in the course: layering, services, protocol design, headers, encapsulation/decapsulation, and marshalling/unmarshalling of parameters.

In the first project of the project you will implement a messaging layer and a simplified remote-method-invocation (RMI) middleware on top of the TCP transport protocol. In the second part, you will implement a small IoT system which exploits the service provided by the RMI middleware.

##### Getting Started

You should start by cloning the Java code which can be found in the git repository XXX.

- describe how to import this into an own repository for the group.

##### Messaging Layer

- describe protocol
- describe what has to be implemented
- add some basic unit tests

##### Remote Methods Invocation

- protocol to be designed on to of the messaging layers
- optional - keep alive feature

##### IoT system implementation

- controller, temperature device, heating element ?, and display - with the controller acting as a coordinating client

##### Hand-in

The running application should be demonstrated - in the lab? - and the code checked in to the github repository.
