Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) - Synchronous RPC

The Java RMI is a language-based implementation of remote procedure call (RPC). 
This code example illustrates an example of implementing a synchronous RPC client-server system.


To run the example code:
Import the project into your IDE

1. Run the RPC Server (ComputerServer.java)
2. Run the RPC Client (ComputeClient.java)
